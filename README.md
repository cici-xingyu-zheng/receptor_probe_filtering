Data used:
To run the notebook to reproduce the filtering, copy all items from "data_monohan_probe_filtering_2025" and rename it "data" under the repo.
Note that some data are huge, e.g., the heterodimer matrix pkl, is 7.5G. Check your RAM to see if it is > 16G; and also make sure to close some apps to free the memory.
